You can see this application [on this page](https://damiinho.github.io/PogadaApp/) (via GitHub Pages).

## App description

The application, after entering the city in the search field, shows the weather forecast. The application is made on the basis of an older version of React, in class components (because I also wanted to learn how to handle the code written in this way).

## View for the current time

In the first view (for the current time), you can check the temperature, time of sunrise and sunset, cloud cover, wind speed and direction, and pressure.
You can also click on the Google Maps link under the name of the city to check its location.
When you click on the panel with information about cloudiness, humidity, etc. it will enlarge and show the meaning of the icons.

## 24 hour view

If you click on the 24h button, you will see the weather forecast for the next 24 hours (for every 3 hours).
You can close this view by clicking outside the application area or by searching for a new city.
